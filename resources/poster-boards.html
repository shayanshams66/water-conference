<p>
  LBRN Poster Boards we make available by request when we're not using them ourselves. They're an A-frame construction that we hand-made out of foam core sheets folded in half, duct tape, and black felt fabric.
</p>

<p>
  They're 4 foot x 4 foot on a side (double sided) and sitting on a table, make a pretty nice way of presenting posters. Generally 3'x4' posters fit great on these (tall or wide).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> only hook side velcro should be placed <u>on the back of the posters</u> to adhere them to these boards. NO clips, pins, tape, etc. nothing else at all should be placed on these boards to put up posters.
</p>

<p>
  Please fill out the request form and someone will get back to you with the details for your picking up the boards and returning them.
