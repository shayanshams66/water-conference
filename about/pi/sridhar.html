abstract: |
  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of the neurotoxic peptide amyloid β (Αβ). Casein kinase 1 family comprises of eight isozymes, two of which CK1δ and CK1ε are predominantly expressed in the brain. CK1δ plays a critical role in AD through phosphorylation of tau, a protein associated with microtubules, which precedes neuritic lesion formation. Thus, CK1δ is implicated in the tau fibrillization reaction pathway. CK1δ is reported to be associated with pathological accumulation of tau in several neurodegenerative diseases including AD, Down syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, and parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam. Inhibition of CK1δ by pan CK1 inhibitors has been shown to reduce fibrillar lesions and to inhibit Aβ production. These studies show the potential for CK1δ specific inhibitors as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders. The reports on development of CK1δ small molecule inhibitors are therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders have been far and few. None of the recently reported CK1δ inhibitors been tested for their efficacy in pre-clinical trials. Our recent work investigating quinones as kinase inhibitors revealed a quinone compound that inhibited CK1δ and Pim1 kinase preferentially over CK1γ2 and 98 other human protein kinases. Similarity search and preliminary in vitro CK1δ kinase inhibition assay have yielded a few compounds with good potency. This proposal aims to further refine the structure of the quinones through molecular modeling studies, design of new derivatives, and synthesis of the designed molecules followed by CK1δ inhibition assays to obtain highly selective and potent inhibitors of CK1δ kinase.
