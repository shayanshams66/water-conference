  Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that result from degeneration of corticospinal tract axons. Patients commonly present with spasticity in the lower limbs, as the longest nerve fibers appear to be the earliest affected. This slowly progressive spasticity is occasionally accompanied by mental retardation and optic neuropathy. To date, thirty distinct chromosomal HSP loci have been identified through genetic linkage analysis of affected families. Of particular interest to this study is the finding that an autosomal dominant form of HSP (AD-HSP) is caused by mutations in the Kif5A gene, a neuronal form of the kinesin family of cellular transport motors. Indeed, fifteen individual missense mutations in the catalytic motor domain of Kif5A have been linked to AD-HSP in separate families. Clinical treatment for HSP is presently limited to symptomatic reduction of muscle spasticity. While this can be effective for short periods, progressive axonal degeneration leads to poor longterm prognoses. As a result, there is a need for a more mechanistic understanding of the primary causes of HSPs. This proposal is targeted at understanding how single AD-HSP-causing mutations in the human Kif5A gene change the function of the kinesin motor. Through a series of well-characterized in vitro studies we will measure the mechanical outputs of Kif5A proteins with human AD-HSP-causing mutations and compare these mechanical outputs to the wild-type protein. We will also attempt to solve the crystal structure of Kif5A proteins with AD-HSP causing mutations in an effort to understand the structure-function relationship between the missense mutations and the behavior of the mutant protein. Our long-term goal is a mechanistic understanding of how mutations in the Kif5A gene alter its normal functions so that ultimately therapies can be designed to treat the fundamental cause of AD-HSP, rather than attempting to treat the physiological manifestation of the underlying dysfunction. In addition, the centrality of kinesin-dependent transport in a host of cellular functions gives the opportunity for outcomes of this study to have far-reaching potential in therapies for other human disorders.
