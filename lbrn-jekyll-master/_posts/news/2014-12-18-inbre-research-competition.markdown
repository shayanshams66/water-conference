**Objective**

The purpose of this new program is to provide an additional opportunity for junior and senior LBRN PUI faculty to engage in clinical and translational research. It is specifically  linked to LA CaTS through collaboration of faculty, training opportunities, infrastructural resources and partial funding. It is targeted at faculty with an interest to extend their research findings into translational and clinical studies. This should be an especially intriguing opportunity to bioinformatics problems related to diagnosis and treatment.

The Online Form will become available in early January, 2015 for the Letters of Intent to be submitted. *We're using an online submission system instead of emailing completed proposals.*
