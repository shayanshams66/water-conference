We are happy to announce that "The 2nd Annual Louisiana Conference on Bioinformatics" will be held on May 15-16, 2014 at the Center for Computation and Technology (CCT), LSU Baton Rouge. The conference is sponsored by the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN), CCT and the LSU-Tulane Center for Experimental Infectious Disease Research. The main goal of the conference is to provide a platform for exchange of information and technical knowledge among Louisiana-based scientists involved in different aspects of bioinformatics.
 
The conference includes Plenary speakers and specialized technology-based presentations on next generation sequencing and advanced molecular and bioinformatics tools. The meeting will provide an opportunity to exchange practical information and facilitate future collaborations among attendees. Participants must register for the conference, since there will be limited seating capacity. The deadline for registration and guaranteed hotel reservations is Thursday May 1st 2014.
 
We invite you to submit abstracts for poster sessions on May 15-16, which will be included in the printed program. Topics include but not limited to: bioinformatics, molecular modeling, next generation sequencing, genomics, proteomics, phylogenetics, protein structure and function, etc. These abstracts can be in the broad areas of research such as cancer biology, infectious diseases, drug discovery, medical diagnostics etc. The last date for submission of abstracts is Monday, May 5th, 2014. The abstract submission form is available to you after you register for the event.
  
We are very excited about this meeting and look forward tour enthusiastic participation! We look forward to your participation in this effort to promote and enhance bioinformatics in Louisiana.
