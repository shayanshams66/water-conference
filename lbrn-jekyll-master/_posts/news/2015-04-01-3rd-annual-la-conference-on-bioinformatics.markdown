We are happy to announce that "The 3rd Annual Louisiana Conference on Computational Biology & Bioinformatics" will be held on April 17 & 18, 2015 at the LSU Digital Media Center (DMC), LSU Baton Rouge. The conference is co-sponsored by the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network (LBRN), the LSU-Tulane Center for Experimental Infectious Disease Research, the Center for Computation and Technology (CCT), and the LSU Office of Research & Economic Development (ORED). The conference aims to expose Louisiana to the cutting edge of Computational Biology, Bioinformatics Research and Applications while also providing  a platform for exchange of information and technical knowledge among Louisiana-based scientists involved in different aspects of computational biology & bioinformatics.
 
The Conference program includes four Keynote speakers highlighting each of four thematic sessions identified by the Scientific Committee. The meeting will provide an opportunity to exchange practical information and facilitate future collaborations among attendees.
  
We are very excited about this meeting and look forward tour enthusiastic participation! We look forward to your participation in this effort to promote and enhance bioinformatics in Louisiana.
