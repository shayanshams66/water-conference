MediVis is a forum for the presentation of original papers in the theory and
applications of visualization to biomedical and medical data. The
symposium covers all aspects of visualization, visual analytics and issues
affecting human-computer interaction with big data from the biomedical
and medical fields. We encourage the submission of papers covering
novel techniques, old techniques applied in novel ways, new methods,
interesting applications and in-depth surveys. Anything related to
biomedical and medical fields as well as HCI in
clinical informatics is of interest.
