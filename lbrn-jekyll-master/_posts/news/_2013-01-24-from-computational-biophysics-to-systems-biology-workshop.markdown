The upcoming workshop on biological physics and systems biology entitled "From Computational Biophysics to Systems Biology 2013 (CBSB13)" will take place at the University of Oklahoma Conference Center in Norman, OK (USA) May 19 through May 21, 2013. There are opportunities for oral presentations, and students/postdocs are eligible for travel fellowships. More details can be found below or at [http://www.hansmann-lab.com/cbsb13](http://www.hansmann-lab.com/cbsb13.).

CBSB13 is organized in conjunction with the Stephenson Life Sciences Research Center at the University of Oklahoma, and will continue a series of successful workshops that have been held since 2006 in both Germany and the USA.

As in previous years, the workshop aims to bring together expertise from physics, biology, and computer science to discuss current trends in computational biophysics and systems biology. Topics of CBSB13 will include folding and aggregation, protein-protein complexes, supramolecular assemblies, cellular environments and interaction networks.

A list of confirmed speakers includes as keynote speakers:

* Hans Frauenfelder (Los Alamos National Laboratory)
* Klaus Schulten (Univ. Illinois Urbana-Champaign)
* Dan Stanzione (Univ. Texas, Austin, and IPlant Collaborative)

and as further invited speakers:

* Ana-Nicoleta Bondar (Free University Berlin)
* Boris Demeler ((Univ. of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio)
* Don Hamelberg (Georgia State Univ.)
* Rohit Pappu (Washington Univ., St. Louis)
* Carol Post (Purdue Univ.)
* Harold Scheraga (Cornell Univ.)
* Art Voter (Los Alamos National Laboratory)
* Eberhard Voit (Georgia Inst. of Technol.)
* Feng Wang (Univ. of Arkansas)
* Tom Woolf (John Hopkins Univ.)

We especially encourage participation by students and postdocs, and we are able to offer financial support for selected students and postdocs on a competitive basis.

Five students/postdocs will be selected to receive a "CBSB13 Young Researcher Award" which we expect to include a $450 travel fellowship, free registration, and the opportunity to give a featured oral presentation.

Contingent on availability of funds, 15 additional students/postdocs will receive travel awards of $250 each and free registration, and will compete for additional oral presentation slots. Another 20 students/postdocs will receive $100 each to cover their registration fee.

All accepted applicants will be able to present their research in poster form.

The *registration deadline is April 15* to be considered for an oral or poster presentation. Acceptance letters and notifications of fellowship awards will be sent out by April 22, 2013.

The registration fee is $100 if paid by May 1, and $150 after this date.

Please circulate this announcement among your colleagues, students, and postdocs; and contact us with any questions you might have by sending email to [cbsb13@ou.edu](mailto:cbsb13@ou.edu).
