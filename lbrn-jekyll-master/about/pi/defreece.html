abstract: |
  Insertional mutagenesis caused by the retrotransposition of the mobile element Long INterspersed Element 1 (L1) and an associated non-autonomous mobile element Alu, have been observed in over fifty separate diseases including breast and prostate cancers (Deininger 2003). Expression and retrotransposition of L1 elements has been recently observed in cancer cell lines as well as patient tumor samples (Cho et al. 2007, Iskow et al. 2009, Lee et al., 2012). L1 has also been linked to cancer progression and a poor prognosis for patients (Roman-Gomez et al. 2005). Retrotransposition of L1 elements occurs by a copy and paste mechanism that requires endonuclease (EN) and reverse transcriptase domains. During retrotransposition the EN of L1 creates a nick within genomic DNA at a canonical target sequence. The target sequence is then used as a substrate for reverse transcription to make a new copy of the L1 element that can be inserted into the genome following the formation of a DNA double strand break (DSB). Our understanding of the role of L1 in creating genetic instability was further enhanced with the knowledge that the activity of the L1 EN results in the formation of DSBs that exceed the observed rate of retrotransposition events (Gasior et al. 2006). The increased number of breaks observed may be due to abortion of the insertion process of new L1 elements by cellular DNA repair machinery that recognize the DNA damage caused by L1. The full contribution of L1 EN activity to genetic instability and disease is currently unknown, but the link between L1 expression and cancer progression warrants a more complete understanding of the direct of effects of LINE1 EN activity. The mobile element field is currently limited in the ability to directly determine the effect of the L1 EN on genomic alteration. Methods such as RNAi and/or knockout mouse models cannot be effectively used to study the role of L1 because of the number of L1 elements in the genome (>500,000 copies) (Lander 2001). The most effective technique to completely determine the contribution of the L1 EN to genetic instability and disease is by direct inhibition of the activity of the L1 EN. The identification of an inhibitor of L1 EN by this study will provide us with the tools required to elucidate the full impact of L1 on genetic instability.
