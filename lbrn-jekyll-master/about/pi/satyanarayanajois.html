  The long-term objective of this research project is to understand the role of extracellular domains of proteins in protein-protein interactions for cell signaling. The short-term objective of this project is to understand the role of domain IV of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) extracellular domain in protein-protein interaction with other epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) in signaling for cell growth. Our hypothesis is that protein-protein interaction surfaces have small core regions which are hydrophobic in nature and protein-protein interactions can be modulated by small molecules that interact with core regions to modulate the signaling for cell growth. As a model system we will investigate protein-protein interactions on EGFR extracellular domains. In particular, we will investigate the interaction of HER2 protein with other EGFRs (EGFR/HER1, HER3). Protein-protein interactions are critical for many biological processes. The interfaces of these protein-protein interactions may have cavities or flat surfaces that are dominated by non-covalent interactions. Analyses of the structures and sequences using bioinformatics approaches have revealed that, although the interacting surfaces are large (700 to 3,000), there are core regions in the surface that facilitate high-affinity interactions. These core regions are dominated by amino acids such as tyrosine, phenylalanine. Thus, small molecules that are targeted to these core regions can be used to modulate protein-protein interactions and may have clinical significance. The protein HER2 is known to interact with other EGFRs to form dimers/heteromers. HER2-mediated heterodimerization leads to signals for cell growth. Deregulation of the signaling pathway via HER2 is known to occur in some tumor cells. HER2 interaction with HER3 and EGFR is known to be dominant in HER2-overexpressing tumors. Blockade of the interaction of HER2 with other receptors ultimately leads to control of cell growth. The extracellular domain of EGFRs consists of four domains, of which domain II and domain IV are known to be involved in the dimerization process. Crystal structures of the extracellular domains of EGFR and HER2-4 are available. The homodimer of the crystal structure of EGFR extracellular domain has been elucidated. However, it lacks domain IV and, thus, the importance of domain IV in dimerization is not understood. Hence, these proteins will serve as good models to understand protein-protein interaction for cell signaling. Furthermore, blocking of domain IV of HER2 protein has clinical significance and, hence, the results from the proposed research can be applicable as â€œtranslational research. The studies presented here can be extended to other protein-protein interactions of biological importance. In the preliminary studies we have carried out, we have shown that a small hydrophobic molecule binds to domain IV of HER2 protein and also inhibits HER2-HER3 interaction in surface plasmon resonance experiments. In the proposed research project, our goal is to understand the importance of domain IV of HER2 in protein-protein interactions and the core region that is critical for dimerization and its modulation for cell signaling.
