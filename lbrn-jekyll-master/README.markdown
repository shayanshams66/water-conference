#### Developing

**Important!** Large files such as images and documents (pdf, word, etc) are not pushed to this repository. Instead, they reside in a special `files` folder that exists on the development and production servers.

Before developing, be sure to copy the `files` folder into the `lbrn-jekyll` folder. To get access to the server, consult [John Quebedeaux](mailto:johnq@lsu.edu).


- You can use `$ jekyll serve` to see your changes on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) while you develop. Press `ctrl+c` to kill the server.

- Edit the site using whatever editor you like. When you are satisfied with your change, add your changed files.
    ```bash
    $ git add .
    ```

- Commit the changes and add a short message explaining what you changed...
    ```bash
    $ git commit -m "added a new news post"
    ```

- And publish your changes to Github:
    ```bash
    $ git push origin
    ```
