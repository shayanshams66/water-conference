Thus,building three-dimensional PPI networks is important to interpret the information encoded in genomes. Predicting PPI sites and the structure of a protein complex are two important related components of this problem. Several computational protein-protein prediction methods have been developed in the past. However, majority of the existing methodologies are designed for experimentally determined protein structures. Because a large number of proteins in a genome will only have structure models available, computational tools must be tolerant to structural inaccuracies in order to be used for genome-wide modeling of PPIs. We contribute to this topic by proposing eFindSitePPI, a software for PPI prediction  that capitalizes on the tendency of the location of binding sites to be highly conserved across  evolutionarily related protein dimers. We show that eFindSitePPI is highly tolerant to structural  inaccuracies in the query proteins and performs better for protein-models when compared to nine other  state-of-the-art prediction methods. Furthermore, we developed eRankPPI, an algorithm to identify correct docking conformations of protein-models as well as experimental structures produced by docking softwares. The scoring function of eRankPPI uses several features including predicted interfaces with probability estimates calculated by eFindSitePPI and contact-based symmetry scores. A comparative study between eRankPPI and other state-of-the-art scoring methods shows that eRankPPI improves the success rate by ~10% on the benchmark dataset of homo and hetero complexes. The encouraging results obtained especially for protein-models open up the possibility for large scale reconstruction of structure-based PPI networks.", "Email": "smahes2@tigers.lsu.edu"},

These interactions control many biochemical pathways. A detailed knowledge about the structure of the interaction surface of proteins and its energetics is necessary to understand the regulatory mechanism of the biochemical pathway with the ultimate goal of modulating or blocking the biochemical pathways for therapeutic purposes. In comparison to protein-small molecule interaction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) surfaces are relatively large.  In addition to this, surfaces of PPI are generally flat and have shallow grooves and pockets that are present at the surfaces of proteins that can bind to small molecules. Although PPI surfaces are large, some small regions of the interacting surfaces contribute to the binding energy more than the other regions. The regions on PPI interfaces that contribute more to the binding energy are called hot-spots. The presence of these hot-spots provides opportunity for targeting PPI with therapeutic agents because compounds that are designed to interact with hot-spots should prevent or block PPI. Interface peptides that mimic the proteins can be used to inhibit PPI, and the molecules designed based on interface peptides are called 'proteomimics'. Computational docking methods are used in several stages during the design of PPI inhibitors including docking of two proteins, finding hot-spots, and screening for a target compound. Using experimental and computational studies we have demonstrated that proteomimics can be designed from PPI interfaces and these can be used as a therapeutic agent or imaging agents. Two sets of PPIs, CD2-CD58 that are important in immunomodulation and EGFR that have significant impact on cancer therapy will be discussed.

Each research group has its own preferred platforms, be it Python, Mathematica, or MATLAB scripts, which can make it hard to integrate someone else's code into your data processing pipeline. These factors can also make it difficult to recall, years later, how any given dataset was processed. Which algorithm was used? Which version of software?    Provenance management systems help to track the history of data processing. VisTrails, freeware developed at New York University, allows for the creation of modules that encompass each step of data processing and the creation of a history tree that tracks changes to the workflow as it is developed. Modules can call other programs, which can help integrate multiple pieces of software into a single workflow. The history tree allows for exploratory actions to be logged so that they can be easily returned to in the future. It is a great step towards making the development of tomography data processing more accessible and shareable.     Here we will showcase two workflows we developed that show the utility of the VisTrails software. The first is an X-ray grating interferometry dataset of a foraminifera gathered at the Advanced Photon Source beam line. The second is a collection of multi-energy (12 keV to 32 keV) scans of a burnt flame retardant/polymer blend. A definite need was noted for an active sample position control system to account for the sample consumption and motion out of the field of view.    The foraminifer data processing involves the evaluation of absorption, phase-contrast, and dark-field images from raw stepped-grating interferometry. The history tracking and visualization methods of VisTrails were useful in carrying out comparisons of various tomography reconstructions. It was also possible to integrate modules to export the dataset to a mobile visualization platform KiwiViewer (developed by KitWare), which allowed for facile viewing and sharing of the results.    Data obtained for the burnt flame retardant presented different issues. The large and multiple data sets required extensive use of high performance computing---a system with solid-state storage and 12 core, 196 GB RAM node---and the management of files between local and remote servers. Also, while the reconstruction methods were similar to the foraminifera project, additional processing was needed in MATLAB and Mathematica to convert the absorptions near K-edge into relative volumen percent of constituent materials. Through the use of custom Python scripting modules, VisTrails was able to handle the switching between applications well.    The modules that were developed for the processing of these two datasets should lead to the development of a custom package for our research group that will then be available to the VisTrails community. Easy sharing of packages allowed by VisTrails should encourage openness of data processing techniques between research groups.", "Email": "jyuan4@tigers.lsu.edu"},

Thus, granting the user total control over the degenerate primer construction process. Using a protein multiple sequence alignment, the application: generates a codon-equivalent multiple alignment (CEMA), scores each nucleotide position using one of four algorithms, and visualizes said scores. Next, a consensus primer set can be designed using Primer 3, an open-source primer design software capable of accounting for positional scores in its objective function, or by inspection. Score-weighted consensus primer design has proven to result in significantly more robust primers than unweighted design. The added features of CEMAsuite now allow the user to quickly estimate the stability, as a Gibbs free energy value, and view the primary structure of a primer template duplex for every CEMA DNA sequence. The hybridization algorithm uses traditional nearest-neighbor thermodynamics with adjustments for specific reaction conditions. A notification system highlights specific cases which are 'unlikely to amplify' based on two readily adjustable input thresholds. Default threshold values were obtained by subjecting PCR amplification results reported in literature to the hybridization algorithm. The degenerate nucleotide handling capability allows for the incorporation of selective degeneracy in the primers in order to obtain a more robust primer set while maintaining a low total degeneracy. The hybridization algorithm handles each primer permutation independently and presents descriptive statistics on degenerate hybridizations. The intent of this expansion is to aid in the design of a low-degeneracy primer set which is robust enough for the applicable assay, yet retains as much specificity as possible.", "Email": "clane6@tigers.lsu.edu"},

The gateway aims to primarily offer a service of the scientific application, Replica Exchange Statistical Temperature Molecular Dynamics (RESTMD), along with other known replica exchange methods (REMs). RESTMD is a recently proposed novel method for enhanced sampling and has various advantages over other sampling methods such as REMD. This work also underscores our long term interest for establishing effective strategies to build versatile, extensible, lightweight, modular science gateways around the DARE framework.  DARE- REM, therefore, addresses a core design goal of DARE-based gateways, the seamless use of heterogeneous distributed cyber-infrastructures (DCIs), which is essential for enabling extreme-scale computational tasks and data analytics.  Among many novel contributions, the implementation of STMD is now available in two community molecular dynamics packages, CHARMM and LAMMPS, which is an attractive point for a wide range of life science researchers. The key workflow for replica exchange methods requires the execution of multiple replicas attempting a pairwise exchange along a simulation run, and is particularly implemented using Hadoop MapReduce.  DARE-REM can submit a RESTMD or REMD job over various HPC cluster systems, Amazon EC2, our testbed CRON, and GENI. In addition to the capacity of utilizing these heterogeneous systems, with the CRON testbed system, interestingly, we demonstrate that RESTMD is capable of the scale-across scenario. Our experience with the GENI virtual laboratory, relatively unknown to the science gateway community, is also presented.

Over 220,000 new leprosy cases are recorded worldwide annually, nearly 60% of which are from India. The dynamics of M. leprae transmission and mechanisms by which it causes nerve damage remain largely unknown.     Using whole-genome sequencing and comparison, we developed a reliable SNP-genotyping scheme that shows excellent association with geographic origins of M. leprae. (Nature Genetics 2009). We also investigated the natural leprosy infection in wild population of armadillos in southern US. These small mammals are high susceptibility to leprosy. Surprisingly, the strains present in armadillos were nearly indistinguishable from the human strains from that region.  This was the first molecular evidence showing zoonotic link between armadillo and with human-leprosy (NEJM 2011). Subsequently, we used a hybridization-capture approach for genome-wide analysis of M. leprae directly from patient biopsies as well as from ~1000 year old leprosy skeletons from Europe. To our surprise, the comparative genomics revealed striking genome-level identity between ancient strains from UK and the current zoonotic strains present in Southern US, confirming the European origin of leprosy in Americas (Science 2013).     Recently, we used innovative and inexpensive methods for DNA-enrichment using biotinylated baits to remove host DNA (Negative selection) and pathogen DNA (Positive selection). Using the combination of these approaches, we reported the first-ever genome of a new uncultivable pathogen M. lepromatosis which is associated with a severe form of human leprosy called  'diffuse lepromatous leprosy' and also identified in the Red-squirrels from Scotland. Comparative analysis of this newly identified species with M. leprae revealed that both species have undergone reductive evolution together and diverged around 13.9 million years ago (PNAS 2015). Further, this work provides valuable genomic insights into biology, pathogenesis and neuropathogenic potential of leprosy bacilli in particular and illuminates on the mycobacterial evolution in general.

Unfortunately, the cytostatic effect of DOX in therapeutic doses is frequently insufficient; however, the use of higher DOX doses is limited by the development of systemic toxicity, especially cardiotoxicity. Many approaches have been used to deliver doxorubicin to the active site by conjugating the drug with peptides, antibodies, hormones, etc. In the current approach, we have attempted to conjugate doxorubicin to a peptidomimetic that is highly specific for HER2 positive cancer cells. The peptidomimetic we have designed (compound 5) is known to bind to extracellular domain of HER2 and inhibit protein-protein interaction of human epidermal growth factor receptors. Different strategies were used to synthesize the conjugate of compound 5 with doxorubicin. To optimize the linkage of doxorubicin to peptidomimetic we used computational docking method. Using the crystal structure of HER2 with 620 amino acid residues of the extracellular domain that represents domain IV of HER2, different conjugates with or without linkers were docked using AUTODOCK software to the region around domain IV.

Rifampin (RMP) is the crucial bactericidal agent in MDT. An increase in relapses and MDT treatment failures due to RMP resistance has been observed in Brazil, which together with the emergence of primary RMP-R Mycobacterium leprae, could undermine existing control measures. WHO recommends PCR-Direct DNA sequencing of RMP resistance determining region (RRDR) of the rpoB gene as a method for surveillance of RMP resistance in clinical isolates. However this technique is not available to most endemic communities and is not cost-effective for large sampling surveys. This project proposed to evaluate the Real-Time PCR high resolution melting analysis (PCR-HRM) as a screening tool for rapid identification of RMP resistance in clinical samples from Brazil, the second most highly endemic country for leprosy in the world. A panel of 14 reference strains, including those containing the most common RRDR mutations leading to RMP resistance, and RMP susceptible wild-type (WT) strains were utilized for optimization of the ML RMP PCR-HRM assay. DNA purified from 64 skin biopsies of leprosy patients who attended the CREDESH - National Reference Center for Sanitary Dermatology and Leprosy Clinic in Uberlandia, Brazil and tested positive for M. leprae DNA were included in this study. Results demonstrated that all characterized RMP-R strains were identified as distinct variants from the WT strain profile. DNA sequencing of the RRDR confirmed the RMP genotypes. Of the 64 clinical samples, we confirmed the WT genotype for 61 (95%) of these samples. Three samples (4.6%) contained the HRM variant profile. One of these (1.6%) had a confirmed RMP-R genotype. Taken together these results demonstrate the utility of PCR-HRM as a reliable screening tool for RMP susceptibility. The HRM is a closed-tube method which avoids post-PCR manipulation and can analyze up to 42 samples in a 96 well-based format within less than 3 hours. This enhances the applicability in endemic regions and reduces cost and time for RMP screening, thereby providing valuable information not only to improve patient treatment outcome but to the global context of leprosy drug resistance monitoring. We recommend that samples with HRM variant profiles be further evaluated by DNA sequencing.", "Email": "saraujo@lsu.edu"},

To address these challenges, we have developed Jacquard, a suite of Python command-line tools that integrate VCFs across different tumor-normal pairs as well as different variant callers to produce a unified variant calling output immediately useful to researchers. Jacquard provides simple consensus calling results, highlights prevalence of variants across samples, and expedites downstream annotation, analysis, and visualization.

However, using libraries such as the ZINC database the vast majority of compounds will have a very low probability to exhibit the desired bioactivity for a given protein. Combinatorial chemistry methods can be used to produce a chemical universe of 1012 to 10180 drug-like compounds to be augmented to existing compound libraries. But, such chemical space is too large to be screened. Consequently, the trend in library design has shifted to produce a screening collection of compounds specifically tailored to modulate the function of a particular target or a protein family. Assuming that the organic compounds are composed of sets of rigid fragments, connected by flexible linkers, a molecule can be decomposed into its building blocks tracking their atomic connectivity. Our method synthesizes new compounds reconnecting these building blocks following the connectivity patterns via an exhaustive graph-based algorithm. In order to evaluate the performance, we have conducted a series of benchmarking calculations against the DUD-E dataset. First, in a self-benchmarking test, we validated the correctness of the algorithm. The object was to recover a molecule from its building blocks. Results show that our approach can efficiently rebuild more than 80% of the active molecules. 90% of the molecules were rebuilt in less than a minute, while half of them took only a fraction of a second to be reconstructed properly. The capability to discover novel scaffolds is also being assessed in a cross-benchmarking test. The procedure mimics a real application, where one expects to discover novel compounds based on a small set of already developed bioactive compounds. We are very optimistic that our effort can contribute to targeted drug discovery particularly in search for novel broad-spectrum antibiotics.", "Email": "mnader5@lsu.edu"},

We applied this technique to identify target genes of the NR4A nuclear receptor NHR-6 in the model organism C. elegans. NHR-6 regulates organogenesis through a DNA-binding mechanism and is necessary to promote cell cycle progression and cell differentiation during the organ formation process. Our ChIP-seq analysis identified 3,222 in vivo genomic binding sites for NHR-6. To identify key transcriptional programs regulated by NHR-6, we employed a multi-step, hypothesis-driven approach to filter binding site data. Our approach involved: 1) selecting binding sites most likely involved in cis regulation of gene expression; and 2) a two-step function-based filter utilizing database information from wormbase.org. The latter involved filtering based on predicted characteristics of NHR-6 target genes, including homology, expression and cellular function. Through this filtering protocol we established a set of 124 putative target genes hypothesized to be critical targets of NHR-6 during organogenesis. We tested the developmental functions of 82 of these putative target genes by RNAi and found that 63.4% exhibited similar loss of phenotypes as NHR-6. Interestingly, several of the genes identified function in cellular pathways that genetic interaction studies suggested were involved in the regulation of, or are regulated by, NHR-6. In addition, for most of the genes, we were able to get secondary confirmation that NHR-6 binds their regulatory regions. Utilization of MotifMutator, a novel motif discovery tool developed for this project, also revealed potential shared binding site motifs in the target gene promoters. Taken together, this integrated analysis of ChIP-seq data has revealed a mechanistic model for how NHR-6 regulates key cellular decisions during organogenesis.", "Email": "gissendanner@ulm.edu"},

Basmati rice is desirable in international market for its unique quality attributes but there is very little information available on genetic diversity of traditional basmati rice. Keeping the above in view, the present study was conducted to know the genetic base and population structure of basmati genotypes grown in NW Himalayas. The present study material consisted of 141 basmati rice accessions representing landraces, farmer's varieties, elite cultivars and breeding lines were using 40 highly polymorphic trait linked SSR markers. Total 112 alleles were detected by the aforesaid primers with a maximum and minimum frequency of 5 and 2, respectively. The maximum and minimum PIC values were found to be 0.63 and 0.17 for the primers RM206 and RM213, respectively, with an average PIC value of 0.41/marker. The average genetic similarity coefficient from all possible combinations was found to be 0.60. Phylogenetic-based cluster analysis of the SSR data, based on distance, divided all genotypes into four groups (I, II, III and IV), whereas model-based clustering method divided these genotypes into five groups (A, B, C, D and E). The basmati rice germplasm were found to have moderate diverse genetic base and high population structure. The diverse genotypes and highly polymorphic trait linked SSR markers identified in the present study will be utilized for the identification of QTLs/genes for different economically important traits and molecular breeding programme of rice in future.

We instead obtained de-identified urological drug screening data from LSUHSC-Shreveport that covers a 13-year period (1998-2011) and consists of 111,359 visits by 71,311 patients.  Though tests for specific drugs varied due to periodic changes in drug testing protocol, these tests consistently tested for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates.  We constructed demographic profiles based on patient's ethnicity, gender, and age classification to determine detection patterns across each class. The majority of visits to LSUHSC-Shreveport include the African American (AA) and Caucasian (Cc) samples; AA represented the plurality of patients.  Most notably, we observed a striking increase of positive tests for cannabinoids in the 0-4 age group; ~10-fold and ~5-fold increases were observed for this age group for AA and Cc respectively. Cocaine positive tests were predominantly found in AA children and adults; however, cocaine positives decreased during this period. Tests for both benzodiazepines and opiates were higher in Cc regardless of age;  although benzodiazepine positives decreased in the general population over the past 10 years, this number had increased ~3-fold for both AA and Cc in the 0-4 age group, while opiate positives increased ~3-fold over  the 13 year period (with greater positives in Cc).  We were also able to use this data to construct a drug history of some patients, finding that 7,721 patients had a positive test on at least two separate visits. Of these patients, cannabinoids, cocaine, and benzodiazepines were most likely to yield a positive result (25.5%, 17.6%, and 16.2% respectively). Work is ongoing to determine this data's applicability respecting the evaluation of the gateway hypothesis.", "Email": "pkilgore@lsus.edu"},

Consequently, while herpesvirus and host cell interactions have been investigated extensively many have defied molecular identification. To identify cellular factors essential for herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) replication, we performed genome-wide screening in the human haploid cell line HAP1. We generated a library of HAP 1 cells lacking one or more nonessential genes by inserting a retroviral gene-trap vector randomly into the cellular genome. By infecting these mutant cells with HSV-1, we identified 10 herpesvirus-resistant cell clones. HSV-1 replication in these cell lines was reduced from 1000 to 10,000 fold compared with those in wild type HAP1 cells. Through immunoblotting and electronic microscopy examination, it was determined that viral gene expression was impaired in some of these cell lines, while viral particles accumulated in either the nucleus or cytoplasm of infected cells in others. Through Next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencer followed by bioinformatics analysis, we chose thirty host genes with high rate of gene-trap vector insertion to investigate the correlation of these genes with the resistant phenotypes. To verify the most relevant mutations, we plan to mutate individual candidate genes using the CRISPR Cas9 gene knock out system, generate individual clones of these cells, and then test for viral resistance in the resulting cell lines.", "Email": "kyang@lsu.edu"},
