	<h4>Presentation Requirements</h4>
	<p>
<span class="text-error">The abstract cannot exceed 2000 characters.</span> Abstracts for research presentations will be printed in the LBRN 13th Annual Meeting Program.
</p>
<p>
Note the type of platform and file type you are sending (i.e. Windows/Powerpoint, OS X (Mac)/Powerpoint, OS X (Mac)/Keynote, etc.) Include any images/movies/etc. into the presentation file (i.e. make sure they are embedded if you referenced external files). Use the standard typefaces on your system. If you send them early enough, John takes the time to check how they look and will let you know if there are any problems. John will be using a single laptop (running both OS X and Windows) to do all the presentations in the interest of saving time for the presentations.

<p>
The deadline to have the slides to John Quebedeaux, johnq@lsu.edu, is <span class="text-error">Friday, January 30, 2015</span> at registration. An emailed link will be provided to upload your presentation, or you can email directly to him.
